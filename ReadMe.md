# Project Guidelines
## Format code to make readability easier
### 2.1 Braces
  * Open braces should always be at the beginning of the line after the statement that begins the block. Contents of the brace should be indented by 1 tab or 4 spaces. For example:
  
      ```C++
        if (someExpression)
        {
           DoSomething();
        }
        else
        {
           DoSomethingElse();
        }
      ```
      
### 2.2 Naming
  * Every variable has to start with a lowercase letter
  * Every function or class has to start with an uppercase letter
  * Do not use Hungarian notation [wtf is this ?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/768255/hungarian-notation-in-c-sharp)
  * Do not use a prefix for member variables (_, m_, s_, etc.).
    If you want to distinguish between local and member variables you should use “this.” in C# and “Me.” in VB.NET.
  * Do prefix interfaces names with "I"
  * Do not prefix enums, classes, or delegates with any letter
